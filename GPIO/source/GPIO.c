/* p4_2.c UART0 Receive
* Receiving any key from terminal emulator (TeraTerm) of the
* host PC to the UART0 on Freescale FRDM-KL25Z board.
* UART0 is connected to openSDA debug agent and has
* a virtual connection to the host PC COM port.
* Launch TeraTerm on a PC and hit any key.
* The LED program from P2_7 of Chapter 2 is used to turn
* on the tri-color LEDs according to the key received.
*
* By default in SystemInit(), FLL clock output is 41.94 MHz.
* Setting BDH=0, BDL=0x17, and OSR=0x0F yields 115200 Baud.
